emane-tutorial
==

The emane-tutorial is a guided walk through deploying a series of emulation 
configurations and scenarios using the 
[EMANE](https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane) emulator. Each demonstration in 
this tutorial is designed to highlight specific capabilities of the emulator. 
The tutorial provides a simple test flow using LXC Containers to create a set 
of test nodes that run emulator instances along with other applications and 
services typically used in the MANET world.


This project contains the configuration and scripts necessary to run the 
tutorial.
